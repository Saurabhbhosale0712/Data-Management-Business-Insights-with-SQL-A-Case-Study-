# Data Management and Business Insights with SQL-A-Case-Study-
This project showcases a SQL-based database management system designed to handle critical data for an IT firm's operations, including Clients, Employees, Departments, Projects, and Employee Project Tasks.

   ## 1. Database Design and Implementation:  
   Create and populate relational database tables (Clients, Departments, Employees, Projects, and EmpProjectTasks) to simulate a real-world business scenario for efficient data storage and management.  

  ## 2. Query Development for Business Insights:  
   Write and execute complex SQL queries to extract actionable insights, such as employee performance metrics, project budgets, and departmental statistics.  

  ## 3. Analytical Reporting :  
   Analyze business data to identify patterns, such as task completion rates, average salaries, and project progress. Use SQL queries to provide detailed reports and visual insights.  

  ## 4. Optimized Data Retrieval and Decision Support:
   Utilize SQL features like joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions to retrieve, filter, and summarize data, supporting decision-making processes like resource allocation and project budgeting.  

These objectives ensure the project remains interactive and focused on practical applications of SQL for data analysis and business intelligence. Let me know if you want to refine these further!

ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸComplete Roadmap to learn SQL ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

1. Basic Concepts
   - Understand databases and SQL.
   - Learn data types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE, etc.).

2. Basic Queries
   - SELECT: Retrieve data.
   - WHERE: Filter results.
   - ORDER BY: Sort results.
   - LIMIT: Restrict results.

3. Aggregate Functions
   - COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN.
   - Use GROUP BY to group results.

4. Joins
   - INNER JOIN: Combine rows from two tables based on a condition.
   - LEFT JOIN: Include all rows from the left table.
   - RIGHT JOIN: Include all rows from the right table.
   - FULL OUTER JOIN: Include all rows from both tables.

5. Subqueries
   - Use nested queries for complex data retrieval.

6. Data Manipulation
   - INSERT: Add new records.
   - UPDATE: Modify existing records.
   - DELETE: Remove records.

7. Schema Management
   - CREATE TABLE: Define new tables.
   - ALTER TABLE: Modify existing tables.
   - DROP TABLE: Remove tables.

8. Indexes
   - Understand how to create and use indexes to optimize queries.

9. Views
   - Create and manage views for simplified data access.

10. Transactions
    - Learn about COMMIT and ROLLBACK for data integrity.

## OVERVIEW:

"In my project, I built an SQL-based relational database to manage data for clients, employees, departments, and projects. I implemented constraints to ensure data integrity and used joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions to efficiently retrieve and analyze data. The project focused on optimizing operations like project tracking and employee management, enhancing my skills in SQL and database management."

## Project Overview:
- Designed and managed a relational database system with tables for Clients, Employees, Departments, and Projects.
- Applied primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity.
- Executed advanced SQL queries, including joins, subqueries, and aggregations for data analysiss.
- Optimized data retrieval and provided insights for business operations and decision-making.


## Key Features:

Table Creation: Defined and created tables for clients, employees, departments, projects, and employee project tasks with appropriate constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and CHECK constraints.

Data Insertion: Populated tables with real-world data to simulate actual business scenarios.
Complex Queries: Implemented SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data, including:
Filtering data by conditions (e.g., displaying employees not working as 'Developers')
Sorting and grouping project information (e.g., projects with budgets > 100,000)
Extracting distinct employee roles and calculating bonuses as a percentage of salary
Technologies Used:
SQL for database design and query processing.
MS SQL Server as the database management system.
Key Queries in the Project:
Display client details for a specific business type.
Show employee details who are not developers.
List projects with budgets greater than 100,000.
Identify tasks that are in progress.
